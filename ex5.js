//Create a while loop that "sings"
//the classic song "99 Bottles of Root Beer
//on the Wall". The code it outputs to the console
//should look similar to this:

//"99 bottles of root beer on the wall,
//99 bottles of root beer...take one down,
//pass it around 98 bottles of root beer on the wall,
//98 bottles of root beer on the wall,
//98 bottles of root beer...take one down,
//pass it around 97 bottles of root beer on the
//wall," etc., all the way to 0 bottles.

i = 99
while (i >= 0){
  console.log(i + " bottles of root beer on the wall")
  i--
}
